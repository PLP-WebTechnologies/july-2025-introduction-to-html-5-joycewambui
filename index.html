      <h2>About This Page</h2>
      <p>Hello! I’m wambui joyce, and this is my webpage.</p>
      <p>I built this page to learn the basics of HTML5 — like using semantic tags, adding headings, and writing content that’s easy to read for everyone (including search engines and screen readers).</p>
  <p>It’s just a start, but I’m excited to keep learning web development and make even better pages in the future!</p>

      <h2>Why We Love Semantic HTML</h2>
      <p>Imagine writing a story where every chapter has a title, and each part fits in the right place. Semantic HTML works the same way: it helps readers (and browsers) know what’s important and where to look next.</p>

  <h2>Why I Love My Cat</h2>
  <p>Meet Luna, my playful and curious cat who makes every day brighter. She’s always exploring, napping in funny places, or quietly keeping me company while I work on my coding projects.</p>

    <h3>Her Little Habits</h3>

    <h3>Why She Means So Much</h3>
    <p>Luna isn’t just a pet — she’s part of the family. Her calm presence makes stressful days feel lighter, and her playful side always brings a smile to my face.</p>
